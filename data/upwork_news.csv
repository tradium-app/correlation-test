Today's addition is perhaps a straw to break the camel's back as consumer-good giant Unilever joins Verizon as two major companies pausing ads on the social network in a grand virtue-signaling show. ""Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech,"" said Luis Di Como, Unilever's executive vice president of global media, in an interview. ""Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,"" the company said in a statement. Its Facebook ban also will cover Instagram. Mr. Di Como said Unilever would like to see a reduction in the level of hate speech on the platforms and wants independent companies to measure and confirm that progress has been made.","UN,UL,UPWK","https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/76548db8-5c4c-4718-bec2-909c093436a6","en","False",""

Several big and small advertisers like North Face, Ben & Jerry's, outdoor apparel stores REI and Patagonia, freelancing platform Upwork, shipping company Local Postal, password manager Dashlane and outwear company Arc'teryx have joined the boycott, among several others. Facebook's head of trust and safety Neil Potts went on a call with about 200 advertisers to discuss the situation, reports the CNN. ""There is a trust deficit. You try to make a decision and people disagree and maybe that builds that deficit even deeper,"" Potts was quoted as saying. Potts told the group of advertisers that Facebook is working to close the trust gap. A Facebook spokesperson later said in a statement that it's normal for them ""to have conversations with advertisers and discuss issues, including policy matters"".","UPWK","https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/5f7d21af-32d6-4e0c-a486-bdce35dd6060","en","False",""

They'll also pitch Lyft as comparable to high-growth Internet companies like Netflix, as well as ""platform"" companies like Square and Facebook. Which companies Lyft gets compared by investors could have a big impact the company's price when it IPOs. Lyft said on Monday that it expects to list with a valuation between $21 billion and $23 billion. Lyft's bankers will compare the ride-hailing app to everything from a luxury fashion retailer to a food delivery service in their pitch to potential investors during the two week IPO roadshow, which kicked off in New York City on Monday. Lyft, which is expected to go public at the end of next week with a valuation between $21 billion and $23 billion, is set to be the first ride-hailing app to trade on the public markets. It's both a challenge and an opportunity for the bankers leading the company's IPO, who are charged with helping investors understand exactly how to value the company, and what other publicly-traded firms it should be compared to when evaluating its value.","UPWK","https://cloud.iexapis.com/beta/news/image/cd2403ac-86bc-40bc-9073-b7e244b7218b","en","False",""
